This is a prioritized list of code analysis tools to be integrated into a BlueJ plugin. 
Prioritizing is done form the perspective of an educator. 

1)	SpotBugs:  
	* Usable as a learning tool that gives direct feedback for bad coding practices.
	* Assists in 

2)	PMD:  
	* intercepts bad coding practices
	*

3)	CPD:  
	* if you can implement PMD, you can implement CPD
	* breaks bad duplication practices that can cause maintenance issues later

4)	Checkstyle:  
	* customizable to instructor’s coding convention

5)	JaCoCo:  
	* Don’t know if it plugs into BlueJ’s testing framework
	* Students may not know JUnit
